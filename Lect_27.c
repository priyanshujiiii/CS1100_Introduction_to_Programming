// Pointers - Recap
//>> int count ; - names a memory cell called count.
//>> Throughout the program the same memory cell gets accessed when we access count.
//>> The address of count is called its l-value.
//>> The value of count (its r-value) may change during the course of the program.

//>> int *countptr; - names a memory cell called countptr.
//>> Throughout the program the same memory cell gets accessed when we access countptr as i-value.
//>> However different cells may get accessed when we access countptr as r-value
